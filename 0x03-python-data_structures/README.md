Prototype: def max_integer(my_list=[]):
If the list is empty, return None
You can assume that the list only contains integers
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use the builtin max()
10. Only by 2

  Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
Prototype: def divisible_by_2(my_list=[]):
Return a new list with True or False, depending on wether the integer at the same position in the original list is a multiple of 2
The new list should have the same size as the original list
You are not allowed to import any module
11. Delete at

Your program should be exactly 5 lines long
13. Linked list palindrome

  Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
